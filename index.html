            <h2>WHY BEYONCE?</h2>
            <h3>Why is Beyonce the best?</h3>
            <p>
              It’s unusual for an artist to be so multi-talented. Beyonce is a
              globally famous, acclaimed vocalist while also being an incredible
              dancer, actress and performer.
            </p>

            <p>
              Her concerts are well-known for their incredible spectacle - the
              sets, the choreography - and she sells out stadiums and arenas
              internationally. She has performed at presidential inaugurations
              and the Super Bowl. Beyonce has been at the peak of the music
              world for over 20 years and has always successfully reinvented
              herself, encompassing so many different genres like R&B, hip-hop,
              rock, country and blues.
            </p>

            <p>
              She has sold over 200 million records and is the most-awarded
              female artist of all time. You can call her Queen Bey!
            </p>

              Hi! My name is Matt and I've been living in Lisbon for several
              years. I'm very fond of the Beyonce’s music. I created this page
              as part of a project for SheCodes Responsive to develop my coding
              skills.
